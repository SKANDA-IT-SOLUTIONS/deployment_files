Inventory:-List of hosts
Frank--->100 Machine
         Each every machine and installing Jdk 8 
		 Ansible-->Angentless

Simple, agentless IT automation
that anyone can use

----------------------------Installation of Ansible---------------------------
--Commands to install Ansible on Master node

        sudo su
	yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm -y
	yum install ansible -y

vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
uncomment inventory and roles_path

vi hosts
public key change after reboot private not change


we will take private key entries and add inside hosts file (agent 1 2) 
webserver they will use private ip's




add the host in a different ways:
ways to add the host entries: 
1.add direct entries

#Agent1  172.31.10.90
#Agent2  172.31.15.185

2.mentioning while running the ansible commands and apply the changes 
 it is difficult, better way to create group 

vi hosts added group entries 
[webservers]
two are webservers agent 1 & agent 2
172.31.10.90---->webserver1
172.31.15.185---->webserver2
[dbservers]
172.31.10.169 is  master ---> dbserver

:wq






webserver group agent1, db server agent2 private ip's



we need to create ssh key

ssh-keygen

after creation of key we will get public key 

you just copy the public key by typing 


cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub


paste this into agent 1 & 2
vi /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC3s+elHa1QBWCZL4EdnIyJIMoOToKjyy2tIDTsvX4UPQrzUDL8GkBUcq2mwmKsYvvCvT1EA4rG5R48chaRcAdU4CiIZomx2eHlFbMO9DQcivlJ5iFsZrsWGzyGilbsepyAYEVo5iXWpy5YgcLv/SAsUkTQAEF4WgTBs8C0rGkKv4+LzCNvcFnBT3XGmd4w1/xVDC8XJMFaJDylGoq1/ji5p+txGvhHs41aiAawivgwCAcUyZhHxhSZ3ytNuAtBBx5F+6+lOgrgdx1C2TqSAvawx7zdfXIBAbBJw6Ffe1q339xa/pLr+4wXFGJfL8yfHW9jDzKsEAfXTZ5sDUl3kAcT root@Ansible-Master
